# JavaScript Stop Watch
I'm working on this stopwatch script and looking to add new features.  

Currently I have the stop-time printing to the console log in ms, seconds and minutes.
The stop-time is the duration the stopwatch is stopped after initial start.

Upcomming Features...
* Laps:  Each time Lap is pressed the lap time will be recorded to a variable Lap 1, Lap 2, Lap 3 and so on.
These variables will be seperate from the overall time.
